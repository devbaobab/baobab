							<b>Awesome and very helpful guide</b><br />
							The course is an extensive one, offering step-by-step approach and simple instructions. There is a collection of videos and extensive guide books, comprising of 37 lectures, that tech you all the secrets and give first hand information. You will be taught on not only how to take the pictures but also what subjects to click. With an arsenal of the right photographs with you, you won’t have much trouble to get your photographs accepted by the big agencies like National Geographic and even get them seen on TV. A bonus in the course is to hear out the interview with the Getty Images Photo.
